# K Means Clustering

For unsupervised learning, you can use k-means-clustering to learn information about how the embeddings are grouped.
This doesn't *necessarily* follow the way that you would normally group things.

e.g. I grouped a series of emotions and this is how it ordered them.

Why excited, depressed and angry? High intensity emotions?

Why is depressed in one but depression in another? Why is angry in one but anger in the one with mostly positive sentiment?
Interesting to think about.

```
[
  [
    "excited",
    "depressed",
    "angry"
  ],
  [
    "happy",
    "happiness"
  ],
  [
    "sad",
    "sadness",
    "depression"
  ],
  [
    "joy",
    "love",
    "loved",
    "loving",
    "excitement",
    "anger"
  ],
  [
    "fear",
    "fearful"
  ]
]
