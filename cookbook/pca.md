# Principal Component Analysis

PCA is very good at deterministically isolating features for dimensionality reduction.

For example:

<img width="689" alt="Screen Shot 2023-11-11 at 2 33 22 pm" src="https://github.com/siliconjungle/vector-embeddings-english-dictionary/assets/71357672/cccc913a-509f-4beb-9b70-b5788e19637e">

You can then interpolate and move through the lower dimensional space.
